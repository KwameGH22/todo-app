# DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

## LANDING PAGE

## HEADER COMPONENT
- In the provided React code, the HTML elements have a parent-child relationship, forming a hierarchical structure. Let's describe the relationships between the HTML elements:

1. Outer Container (div with Tailwind CSS classes):
    - Parent: None (top-level container).
    - Children:
        - Inner Container (div with Tailwind CSS classes).
        
2. Inner Container (div with Tailwind CSS classes):
    - Parent: Outer Container.
    - Children:
        - Heading (h1 with Tailwind CSS classes).
        - Conditional Rendering (BsSun or FaMoon based on darkMode).

3. Heading (h1 with Tailwind CSS classes):
    - Parent: Inner Container.
    - Children: None.

4. Conditional Rendering (BsSun or FaMoon based on darkMode):
    - Parent: Inner Container.
    - Children: None.

- The structure can be visualized as follows:

```plaintext
- Outer Container (div with Tailwind CSS classes)
  - Inner Container (div with Tailwind CSS classes)
    - Heading (h1 with Tailwind CSS classes)
    - Conditional Rendering (BsSun or FaMoon based on darkMode)
```

In this structure, the outer container provides overall styling and layout directives. The inner container contains the heading and the conditional rendering of either the sun (BsSun) or the moon (FaMoon) icon based on the value of darkMode. The heading serves as the main title for this section.

The conditional rendering suggests that the appearance of the content may change based on the state of darkMode, providing a dynamic and potentially interactive user experience.
